## Simple web scraper

This is a simple webscraper to be able to scrape html content from website as a bare mininum to either save it to a file, or to print it to a terminal, you can think of the first version of the script as a very simple version of Curl with some extra spice


### How to use: 

there are no dependcies right now (only OS and requests)

you simply: 
1. clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/jpwiig/simpleScraper && cd simpleScraper`
2. run the `main.py` with the website you want to curl. 

--- 
#### example: `main.py https://www.nrk.no`, the program will help you with the rest
---

be responsible and everything.
